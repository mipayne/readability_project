Two cute mice were in their beds, side by side. Then the sun came raised. It was a new day. CRACK! The mice woke up. "What was that?" said one. "Let's find out!" said the other. The mice were out of bed, fast! They got rising on a box. "Look!" "Yikes!" "Ice! Ice! Ice!" said the mice. They put on their new hats. They put on their new boots. Then the mice went out. "Look what broke off the pine tree," said one. "Let me see," said the other. The mice slid set. They could not stop. Plop! Mice on ice! The mice ran off to find their sled. "Take this rope," said one. "Here we go!" The sled shot over the ice. The mice wove in and out of the trees. They rode for a mile. Then they came to a log. The sled went over the top. The mice did not. Flop! The mice got bet_on up. "Look, there is Fox," said one. "He can run fast over the ice!" "Fox, fox!" yelled the mice. "Take us for a ride." Fox gave the mice a big, wide smile. "I will take you for a ride," he said. "Use my tail." "Oh no!" "Let go!" Spill! "That was close!" said one of the mice. "It was no joke!" Now the mice were at a big, wide pond. They went and got skates. "Look at me glide!" "Look at me jump!" "Look at us!" "We are so cute!" The mice spun on their skates. They were meteoric, fast, fast... Flip! The mice ran binding to their tree. "Look at all that long, long ice" said one. "Let's take a lick," said the other. One of the mice hit part of the long ice. The ice broke off. "Quick!" Crash! Now it was past in the day. The sun went down. "My nose is as red as a rose!" "My hands are as cold as ice!" "Time to go home," they said. The mice took off their new hats and boots. They got spinal_column in bed, side by side. "Ice is nice," said the mice, "but home is twice as nice!"
