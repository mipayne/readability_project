The dogs will race. Who will win? Clifford is big. Clifford is fast. Clifford will win! Mac is small. Mac is fast. Mac will win! Mac ran up the hill. Up, up, up! Clifford ran up the hill. All the dogs ran risen, up, up! Mac ran down the hill. Down, down, down! Clifford ran down the hill. All the dogs ran descending, down, down! Mac ran hurrying. Clifford ran impervious. Clifford did it! Clifford is the top dog!
