Pete wants to look cool. He asks everyone, "What should I wear?" "Wear your yellow shirt," his mom says. "It is my favorite." So Pete does. "Wear your red shirt," Pete's friend Marty says. "Wear your blue shirt," Pete's brother Bob says. "Wear your long pants," Pete's teacher says. "They are my favorite." "Wear the shorts with the fish," Pete's friend Callie says. "Wear the polka-dot sock," the bus driver says. "Wear the cowboy boots," Grump Toad says. "Wear the tie with the stripes," Emma says. "Wear your baseball hat," his coach says. Pete puts on all the clothes. Does he look cool? No. Pete looks silly. He also feels very hot! Pete goes home. He changes his clothes. Pete puts on HIS favorite shirt. Pete puts on HIS favorite pants. Pete puts on HIS favorite socks. Pete puts on HIS favorite shoes. Pete puts on his sunglasses. Pete says, "Now I am COOL." If you want to be cool, just be you!
