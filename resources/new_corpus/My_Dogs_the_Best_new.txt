My dog's the best. He's big! My dog's the best. She's small. She's short. He's tall. No, my dog's the best. No, my dog's better than yours! She's smooth. He's shaggy. She's got a pompon on her tail. Her tail is waggy. She hugs me. He licks. He protects me. She does tricks. He's fast! She's slow. He's silly!My dog's the best. She's for show. Hear her bark! Hear him whine. No, my dog's the best! My dog's the best because he's mine! I'm the best! =======
