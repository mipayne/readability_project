What do you see where it rains each day? What do you see in the rain forest? Cubs jump and play in the trees where they stay. That's what you see in the rain forest. Ants make their way as they feel the rain spray. A bird takes a rest and stays in her nest. A snake slips away from the eggs that she lays. A lizard makes trails as he swishes his tail. A frog shakes the leaves as he hops from the trees. A sloth hangs and sways and sleeps all day. Birds stay in the shade where they like to wade. Bats fly away at the end of the day... That's what you see in the rain forest. All in a day in the rain forest.
